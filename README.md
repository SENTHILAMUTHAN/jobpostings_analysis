 In this case study, we will follow the steps of the data analysis process: prepare, analyze, share to get a idea of the job postings on linkedin.

## Data sources
 The primary Data source used for this analysis was downloaded from the kaggle and been uploaded in this repository by the name "actualkaggledata.csv" which contains Dataset of jobpostings on Linkedin
 
## Tools
- Excel - Clean and transform the data to prepare for analysis
- SQL(BQ) - Conduct descriptive analysis to get  a better sense of the data layout and find the needful answers.
- PowerBI - Creating a overall dashboard
- tableau - Creating seperate worksheets for seeing a clear trends

## Data cleaning/Preperation
 1. Actual dataset didnt have Dates and  so it was generated by "=RANDBETWEEN()" function in excel. The dates are between 1/01/2023 to 23/09/2023.
 2. Companies having 1 employee were replaced with Random numbers  between the range of (11 - 50 ) and (100 to 150)
 3. In the industry coulumn values of "Not Available " has been replaced with  "Information Technology & Services"
 4. In the level coulumn values of "Not Available " has been replaced with "Entry level"
 5. Creating a Dataset in BQ by the name "jobanalysis" and uploaded the cleaned file to the table named "cleaned"

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
 1. EDA involves analysis of the dataset to find 
     - Last 30 days job count by company, job type, city ,state
     - Last 30 to 60 days job count by company, job type,  city ,state
